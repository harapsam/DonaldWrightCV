                <p>The project funded by this grant combines two fields of expertise that are at the foundation of my intellectual identity, the humanities and the sciences.  It involves the study of demographic changes of urban populations in the MENA region over the 20th and 21st centuries.  A large part of the project involves gathering and organizing data as the principal challenge of this project is finding meaningful datasets for analysis.</p>

                <p>Understanding future demographic trends and how cities will be able to adequately house swelling populations like those of the Middle East in the future is a topic that is at the core of many research centers.  The outcomes of this study, to be found on the API of the Nazha Project, which I produced with the help of this grant, will be important for professionals working in urban development, public health and civil engineering as it will give us an understanding of how many new constructions will be needed for future populations and also what kind of constructions will be ecologically and economically efficient for living in harsh conditions.</p>

                <p>In essence, this work has two branches, one more theoretical in nature, and another that is based in statistical analysis.  The goal is to artfully bring together these two tangential fields to demonstrate how urban planning and construction are a direct result of population migrations.  Sometimes these population shifts are intentional on the part of regional officials.  Often, however, demographic shifts are the unforeseen consequences of regional ecological changes.  One of the strengths of this study is to gather and extrapolate data and to then examine it in light of theoretical shifts in mentality and quotidian daily habits to draw conclusions that are essential for understanding the future demographic trends that will shape the Middle East and North Africa over the coming decades.</p>
