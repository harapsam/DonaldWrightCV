                <p>For many years I have been working in the Middle East and North Africa.  But perhaps my first encounter with the Arab world was working in France where I had many students and friends of Arab origin.  This made me reflect on our stereotypical image of culturally hereditary nomadism and the reality of urban populations today.  I have been able to share my experiences and help students understand the impact of human migrations in the MENA region today in various classes in international relations and refugee studies.  I was also invited to give a lecture at Haigazian University in Beirut and at the Kennedy Center for International Studies at Brigham Young University.</p>

                <p>My first encounter with forced migration was in Iraq in 2016 working with victims of human rights abuses at the hands of Islamic State combatants.  I travelled the country of Iraq from Basra to Dohuk documenting ISIS atrocities to be recorded for future trials and reconciliation so people could return to a meaningful and peaceful life.  However, the scope of the project quickly changed as suicide rates in camps of IDPs displaced because of ISIS was around 50%.  So more than just documenters we became counselors.  Suicide rates dropped by 75% within a few weeks.  This project got me thinking how on a larger scale there will be more and more people displaced in the world because of climate change and the effects that will have.</p>

                <p>In 2023, I was awarded a <a href="page-fulbright.html" style="text-decoration: none">Fulbright-Hays Faculty Research Abroad grant</a> to work on just that: populations who had been displaced and been subjected to a rural/urban migration because of climate change.  Part of this project involves looking at data and the importance of interpreting data to understand larger trends in human migration, which is described in this <a href="page-machine-learning.html" style="text-decoration: none">link</a>.</p>

                <p>All of these experiences tied together led me to create the Nazha Portal.   The Nazha Portal provides the user with data models and projections concerning climate change and human migrations in Morocco because of dramatic changes in ecosystems.  Data is important when we analyze human migration and economic hardship because it provides valuable insights into the causes and consequences of these phenomena. By collecting and analyzing data, we can better understand the patterns, trends, and drivers of human migration and economic hardship, as well as the impacts they have on individuals, communities and societies.  The primary goal of the Nazha Portal is to supply interactive data charts that inform us about human migrations within Morocco, so that we can identify dispersed communities and interconnect people living in diaspora, create a living archive of their experiences for futures generations and maintain a sense of community identity in displaced settings.</p>
