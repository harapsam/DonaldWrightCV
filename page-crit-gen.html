                <p>     Critique génétique, or genetic criticism, is a method of literary analysis that originated in France and which involves examining the writing process of an author by studying multiple drafts and revisions of their work.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="page-entry statement col-lg-6">
                <p>The term "genetic" in this context refers to the genesis or creation of a literary text. The goal of genetic criticism is to uncover the various stages of development that a work of literature undergoes, from its earliest notes and sketches to its final published form.  This approach to literary analysis emphasizes the importance of the author's creative process and the ways in which it shapes the final product.</p>

                <p>     I am fortunate to have been able to explore narrative genesis in the works of Proust under the direction of Antoine Compagnon, a member of the Académie Française.  He also prefaced my book on the topic, which is linked to <a href=page-publications.html style="text-decoration: none">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="page-entry statement col-lg-6">
                <p>     The study that I conducted on the works of Marcel Proust involved examining the vocabulary used in various medical texts from the end of the 19th century and analyze how exactly he adopted these words and their meanings, sometimes altering them, to create a rich linguistic tapestry that oscillates between the poetic and the purely scientific.</p>
