                <p>Climate change plays a vital role when we talk about the built environment.  Urban land expansion, the process of creating the built environment to house urban populations and their activities, is one of the fundamental aspects of urbanization. Urban land expansion modifies habitats, biogeochemistry, water usage, land cover, and surface energy balance. Urban populations are expected to almost double from 2.6 billion in 2000 to 5 billion in 2030 and urban acreage is forecast to triple in that same timeframe.  Of course, all of that land that at the onset is non urban designated will be subject to a rural/urban conversion.</p>

            <div class="page-entry statement col-lg-6">
                <p>The impact that climate change will have on human migration in the future will be more deeply rooted, long term and have more far-reaching consequences than migration because of conflict.  The solution to IDPs and refugees of climate change will not be temporary housing or UNHCR migrant facilities; they will need to have more long-term sustainable housing in a place where they and their descendants will be able to lead inclusive, meaningful and fulfilled lives.</p>

                <p>It is essential to keep an archive of indigenous knowledge of migrating people about traditional and regional practices, which include farming, the exploitation of regional materials, artisanship and building techniques.  This will enable civil engineers to present projects for urban development that will remain rooted in the experiences of heritage building, which, more than smart cities, will be a way to reduce the carbon footprint of the urban setting.  I have often been invited to give talks on the built environment and the importance of traditional building techniques in the modern cityscape.</p>

                <p>As real estate speculators create new spaces void of any one cultural meaning, the built environment is constantly shaped by changing ideas and values; it is also very much a culturally constructed place.  In this respect, the discourse underlying the rise of the sustainable smart city is a hegemonic one that acts to regulate the way we think, talk and write about the urban and cultural heritage.  This discourse adopts a professional, scientific tone that privileges expert values and knowledge about the past and the future, and their material manifestations in the present with a disregard to the lived experiences of migrant populations.  My interest in the built environment is to create an archive of human experiences so that people who migrate to cities can feel connected.  This is why I created the Nazha Portal.</p>
