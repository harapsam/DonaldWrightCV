                <p>     Museography is important for understanding how museums functions as institutions, how they present and interpret their collections, and how they engage with their audiences. It encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including history, anthropology, art history, conservation, and cultural studies.</p>

            <div class="page-entry statement col-lg-6">
                <p>     Museography is concerned with the design, organization, and management of museums, including the physical layout of galleries, the selection and presentation of objects, and the development of interpretive materials. It also examines the ways in which museums acquire, preserve, and document their collections, as well as the ethical considerations involved in these processes.</p>

                <p>     I have had the opportunity to work in different museums, including the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, the <em>Musée des Beaux Arts de Nancy</em> as well as the Louvre Museum in Paris.  The has enabled me to understand how museums play a crucial role in shaping public perceptions of historical analysis and how they are essential in the creation of cultural narrative.</p>

                <p>     I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to work at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh as an assistant to the Head Curator, Sarah Nichols, and to participate in curating an exhibition, <em>Aluminum, From Jewelry to Jets</em>.  In addition, I interned at the <em>Musée des Beaux Art de Nancy</em> under the direction of Claude Pétry, and at the Louvre Museum in the department of <em>objets d'art</em> under the guidance of Daniel Alcouffe.</p>
