                <p>     The exploration of data is something that has always fascinated me.  My interest in philology has its roots in the collection and analysis of data.  I have also worked in the Middle East with displaced populations, which is highlighted <a href=page-idp.html style="text-decoration: none">here</a>.  This is what inspired me to combine all of my passions into one area research.

                <p>     Data is essential for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of policies and programs designed to address human migration and economic hardship. By tracking key indicators, such as employment rates, poverty rates, and migration flows, we can assess whether interventions are achieving their intended goals and make adjustments as needed.  </p>

                <p>     But data alone is meaningless.  This is what motivated me to start the Nazha Project.  The primary goal of the Nazha Portal is to supply interactive data charts that inform us about human migrations within Morocco, and eventually the entire MENA region, so that we can identify dispersed communities and interconnect people living in diaspora, create a living archive of their experiences for future generations and maintain a sense of community identity in displaced settings.</p>

                <p>     The Nazha Portal provides the user with data models and projections concerning climate change and human because of dramatic changes in ecosystems.  Data is important when we analyze human migration and economic hardship because it provides valuable insights into the causes and consequences of these phenomena. By collecting and analyzing data, we can better understand the patterns, trends, and drivers of human migration and economic hardship, as well as the impacts they have on individuals, communities, and societies. </p>
