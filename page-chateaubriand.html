                <p>The Chateaubriand Fellowship is a prestigious fellowship program offered by the Embassy of France in the United States. It is designed to support doctoral students from American universities who wish to conduct research in France in the fields of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, humanities, and social sciences.  It is named after François-René de Chateaubriand, a French writer, diplomat, and politician who lived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  Being a Chateaubriand Fellow allowed me to explore the writings of Proust and analyze forgotten medical texts that were important for the construction of his narration.</p>

                <p>Marcel Proust's novel "In Search of Lost Time" is a popular subject for genetic criticism, as the author's manuscripts and notes have been extensively studied and analyzed. The genetic approach to Proust's work has shed new light on the writing process and the evolution of his ideas.  My study also focused on the various drafts and revisions of the novel and the changes in language, structure, and characterization that occurred between the earliest drafts and the final version of the text, in order to understand how Proust developed and refined his ideas over time.  My study contributed to a vast corpus of knowledge that helps understand Proust's writing process and how medical discourse permeated all aspects of 19th century society.</p>
