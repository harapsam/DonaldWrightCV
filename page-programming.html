                <p>     Being of a mathematical mind with a passion for languages, I find myself to be good at computer programming and have a degree in computer science.  I have strong analytical skills, problem-solving abilities and attention to detail. These skills are essential for creating and analyzing algorithms.  When designing algorithms, or reverse engineering, you need to have a solid understanding of concepts like logic, data structures, and algorithms. A mathematical mind can help you break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, which can be analyzed and solved more easily.</p>

                <p>    Being good at languages has also been beneficial since it has given me a strong understanding of grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. This skill is also essential for computer programming because programming languages have their own syntax and grammar rules. Understanding these rules is crucial for writing clear and concise code that can be easily read and understood by other programmers. Moreover, programming languages are constantly evolving, so being good at languages can help you learn new programming languages more quickly.  I find one of the most fun ways to examine algorithms is by using Csound or MiniAudicles, which enables us  to 'hear' the algorithm.</p>
