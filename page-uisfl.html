As the world becomes more interconnected, understanding other cultures, economies, and political systems is essential for success in many fields.  The UISFL grant funded by the US Department of Education was important for undergraduate instruction for many reasons.  It increased cultural awareness by exposing students to different cultures and ways of life and helping them to develop a greater appreciation for diversity and an understanding of other people's perspectives.  Better understanding of a wide range of global issues, including climate change, human rights and economic inequality. By studying these issues, students gained a deeper understanding of the challenges facing the world today and developed the skills needed to address them. This curricular development expanded career opportunities for students. As companies and organizations expand globally, there is an increasing demand for employees with international experience and knowledge. Curriculum having an array of global topics provided students with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in these types of careers.</p>
