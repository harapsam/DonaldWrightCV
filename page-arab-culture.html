                <p>My experiences in the Arab world and with Arab language and culture go a long way back.  From an academic point of view, I completed a <a href=page-certificates.html style="text-decoration: none">certificate in Modern Standard Arabic</a> at the University Mohammed V in Rabat, Morocco.  However, that is really only the beginning of a very long adventure that would take me all over the Arab world.</p>

                <p>As a professor, I have shared my passion with students in courses on Arab history and culture, post-colonial, international and refugee studies.  In addition, I was a two-time <a href="page-neh.html" style="text-decoration: none">scholar in residence for the National Endowment for the Humanities</a> and community leader for their series <a href="https://bridgingcultures-muslimjourneys.org/" style="text-decoration: none"><span><em>Bridging Cultures, Muslim Journeys</em></span></a>.  I was also the PI on a federal <a href="page-uisfl.html" style="text-decoration: none">UISFL grant</a> awarded to Hood College to promote foreign language and international studies, which involved working with education centers in Oman, Morocco and Jordan.</p>

                <p>In 2023, I was awarded a <a href="page-fulbright.html" style="text-decoration: none">Fulbright-Hays Faculty Research Abroad</a> grant dedicated to supporting displaced communities affected by climate change by providing them with the resources and tools necessary to rebuild their lives and preserve their cultural heritage by creating an archive of indigenous knowledge in order for communities living in diaspora to remain connected and build meaningful sustainable lives following a rural-to-urban migration.  Indigenous knowledge plays an important role in preserving local cultures, promoting sustainable land use practices, and adapting to changing environmental conditions.</p>

                <p>One of the most rewarding projects that I have undertaken was in 2016, before the battle to take back Mosul in Iraq.  I travelled across Iraq, from Basra to Dohuk talking with displaced people who suffered human rights violations at the hands of Islamic State combatants. Read more about it at this <a href="page-idp.html" style="text-decoration: none">link</a>.  All of these experiences have helped me to build a vast love for and knowledge of the Arab world.</p>
