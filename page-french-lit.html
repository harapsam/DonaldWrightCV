                <p>     My first introduction into the world of research was in the realm of philology and narratology.  I completed an undergraduate degree and Masters in French Literature.  From there I received a <a href=page-chateaubriand.html style="text-decoration: none">Chateaubriand Fellowship</a> from the French government which allowed me to continue with my PhD at the Sorbonne under the direction of Antoine Compagnon.</p>

            <div class="page-entry statement col-lg-4">
                <p>     During my time at the Sorbonne, I was able to explore how science and scientists are the purveyors of cultural hegemony.  I dove into the world of scientific discourse and how the creators of that discourse have enabled people to reexamine their relationship to natural laws, but also how institutional discourse can be used as a tool to separate people from their identity by losing control of their physical body.</p>

            <div class="page-entry statement col-lg-4">
                <p>     I have written two books, one on the scientific discourse in Proust, and another on the importance of Greco-roman antiquity in the creation of French national identity in the second half of the 19th century.  The reference to them can be found at this <a href=page-publications.html style="text-decoration: none">link</a>.  As a professor, I have taught American students in various courses on modern French thought and literature.</p>
